								<b>RAM:</b> Your computer uses RAM, random access memory, to perform functions and operations. More RAM allows your computer to perform more tasks simultaneously and run faster. You can boost performance by installing additional RAM or replacing the existing computer hardware with larger memory sticks. RAM is easy to replace on a desktop, but you may have to check your user’s manual for instructions to add or remove RAM on a laptop.
