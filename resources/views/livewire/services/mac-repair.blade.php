									<p>Water damage affected your Mac? Our Apple water damage repair service is the quick and cost-effective way to save your computer. Whether it’s a MacBook, a MacBook Pro, an Air or a desktop, we’ll replace the affected parts and get your computer working again.</p>
									<p>Apple’s one year limited warranty, which is sold with all new Apple products, doesn’t cover your machine in the event of water damage. Neither does the Apple Care Protection Plan. And the average Apple water damage repair cost is high. In many cases, it can be more cost-effective to throw a water-damaged Apple product in the bin, and replace it with a brand-new model.</p>

									<p>MacBook battery died? Don’t consign your computer to the rubbish heap just yet. Our MacBook Pro battery replacement service is fast, fairly priced, and usually completed on the same day. And we’ll even come and pick your computer up from your home or place of work.</p>
									<p>When you buy a MacBook, you buy quality. Unfortunately, the solid build and aluminium case come with a payoff. They aren’t designed to be opened by the owner. And that means, when the battery reaches the end of its useful life, you’re recommended to return the whole computer to your nearest Apple store. Official MacBook Pro battery replacement is costly. </p>

							<p>And if you don’t live near an Apple store, it can can take several days to complete. We use the same quality batteries you’d get if you paid Apple premiums for your MacBook battery replacement, but our service is much quicker and much cheaper.</p>

Not what they’ve got printed on the box. And because we pick up and drop off your iMac ourselves, we don’t have to charge you extra for shipping and handling.</p>

We like to think of it as our own little stroke of ‘genius’. Our iMac repair service is secure, too. As in, really secure. We require all of our engineers to sign their own non-disclosure agreements.
